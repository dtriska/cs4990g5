## Project Outline Report

### Description
For our project, we aim to create a dynamic website hosting a resume that can be easily updated through a GitHub repository. The website will be developed using AWS Amplify and will ensure a secure connection using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) with a CloudFront distribution for enhanced website security. Additionally, a key feature of our website will be the integration of a project showcase, such as hangman or tic-tac-toe, leveraging AWS services for serverless interactions.

### Components
- **Website Development Stack:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- **AWS Components:**
  - Amplify or S3 for web app creation
  - CodePipeline to establish a connection with the GitHub repository pipeline infrastructure
  - DynamoDB for database management
  - Lambda for serverless interactions with the website
  - Amazon API Gateway for seamless front-to-back-end communication
  - ACM with CloudFront for robust website security
